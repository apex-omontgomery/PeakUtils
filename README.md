This is a forked repository from the user: /lucashnegri on bitbucket.
There was an apparent change to numpy in which using a list was no longer valid only when you wanted to prevent peaks within a certain range. 
If you didn't discriminate against peak closeness then the issue didn't appear. 

I did a bunch of tests manually then made peak_test.py to automate random list input.
